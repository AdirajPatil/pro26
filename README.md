#chocoLavaCakeRecipe
To make this lava cake, you only need cocoa powder, baking soda and chocolate. The rest of the ingredients are easily available in an Indian kitchen. i have used bitter sweet chocolate to get the molten lava. You can use sweet or semi sweet chocolate too. Just make sure to use both good quality chocolate and cocoa powder. If possible do use couverture chocolate that has cocoa butter in it.

I used mason & co cocoa powder and cocoacraft bitter sweet chocolate – 70% cocoa. The whole wheat flour is chakki ground organic whole wheat flour.

For the oil, you can use sunflower or olive oil. I have used both these oils on different occasions while preparing this choco lava cake.

You can make the recipe in ramekins or aluminium foil cups. You can also use muffin liners or a muffin tray. If using muffin liners or muffin tray, then you won’t be able to remove the lava cake from it.

This recipe can be easily doubled And makes for 3 medium sized molten lava cakes which are almost like large muffins. Thus making for 3 portions or 3 servings. One cake is enough for 1 person. If you have more family members, then you can double the recipe.

4. Next add ¼ teaspoon baking soda. Since baking soda is the only leavening ingredient used in the recipe, do make sure that its fresh and active. To check the freshness of baking soda, dissolve a bit of baking soda in a solution of vinegar+water. It should fizz and bubble immediately. If not, then the baking soda is not fresh and active.

19. Place chocolate squares in the batter. I have used 70% cocoa bitter sweet chocolate. Please use good quality couverture or compound chocolate which are meant for baking to get the lava effect. Use chocolates which are firm and hard. Avoid using chocolate which are soft, semi-soft or fluid. Please do not use ready to eat chocolate like dairy milk etc.

20. With a spoon or wired whisk lightly press them so that they get immersed in the batter. If you have a chocolate slab, then chop the chocolate before you prepare the batter. The batter should immediately go in the oven as soon as possible.

Baking chocolate lava cake
21. Place the ramekins in the center rack of the oven. Bake at 200 degrees celsius for 30 to 40 minutes. In my oven the baking took about 35 minutes. During the last 10 minutes do keep a check. also open the oven door only after ¾th of the cakes are baked. If you open early or open many times, the lava cakes can fall flat. I generally bakes lava cakes well as I do not want my folks to eat any uncooked batter.

22. Baking time varies with various oven makes and models, so it can take less than 30 mins or more than 35 minutes. Check with a toothpick on the sides of the cake and it should come out clean.

23. Let the chocolate lava cakes cool for two to three minutes. Then with a butter knife gently loosen the edges from the top. The cake is so light and soft, you do not need to use the butter knife way to the base of the ramekins.

24. Invert the ramekin on a serving plate. Gently tap the bottom of the ramekin. The ramekins will be hot, so be careful when picking and tapping them.

25. Remove the ramekin gently and the cake gets unmolded easily. Sift some cocoa powder or powdered sugar on top through a sieve. You can also serve molten lava cake with ice cream like vanila ice cream or chocolate ice cream or mango ice cream or some berries or fruits by the side.

Choco lava cakes have to be served hot or warm. once they cool, the molten chocolate solidifies. But even at room temperature these lava cakes taste good.
